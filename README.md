# Timeline App

A simple interactive timeline application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## Features

- Interactive drag-and-drop timeline
- Zoom in/out functionality
- Lane management for timeline items
- Responsive design

## Experience
- I managed to implement the main functionality, rendering a timeline with items, so I'm satisfied, though it could be better, but satisfied.
- I would focus on functionalities like drag and drop and date changes first, to get the complex part out of the way, and I would structure it better, with animations for a pleasant fluidity.
- I used the Dropbox timeline as shown in the Google Docs example as inspiration.
- I would focus on the main functionalities that make up the timeline: drag and drop, data resize, card update, to ensure these key points are okay, then design, UX, and other details."
